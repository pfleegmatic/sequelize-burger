# sequelize-burger
Continuation of the burger assignment
This model still uses 
1) Node, 
2) Express server, 
3) Handlebars (HBS)
4) MySQL database used, 

But instead of a having a homemade orm.js file (last assignment), that is switched to Sequelize ORM.

To start, do a pull:
-npm install
-node server.js

You might need to add another npm package depending on the outcome of running the code.
-npm install sql2
